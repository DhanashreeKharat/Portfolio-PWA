A responsive portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and experience as a web developer. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline support and app-like installation.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
2. 
2. **Open Locally**:
- Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site.
- For full PWA testing, serve it over HTTPS (use a local server like `python -m http.server` or deploy to GitHub Pages).

3. **Customize**:
- Edit `index.html` for personal details (e.g., bio, projects).
- Update `styles.css` for styling tweaks.
- Modify `manifest.json` and `sw.js` for PWA settings.
- Replace `yourformid` in the contact form with your actual Formspree ID (sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)).

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
- Push changes to your GitHub repo.
- Go to Repository Settings > Pages, select "main" branch and "/ (root)", and save. Your site will be live at `https://yourusername.github.io/portfolio-website`.

## Usage

- **Navigation**: Use the header menu to jump to sections (About, Skills, Projects, Contact).
- **Projects**: Click "View Demo" to explore project pages (e.g., `question-bank.html` for the Question Bank Generator).
- **PWA Installation**: On supported browsers (e.g., Chrome), look for the "Add to Home Screen" prompt to install as an app.
- **Offline Mode**: Test by disabling network in DevTools—cached resources should load.
